# Ansible

These are the slides / source code for a presentation I made covering
[Ansible](http://ansible.com).

This was presented at [DevTricks](http://softwareniagara.com/#devtricks) in
2014.

The presentation uses [Deck.js](https://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js).

### Running the Demo

All source code for the demo is available in demo/
